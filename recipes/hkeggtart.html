        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Hong Kong egg tarts are found commonly served at Chinese dim sum restaurants on small plates in twos or threes. They are derived from the English-style custard tart and the Portuguese-style pastel de nata.</p>

            <p>Hong Kong egg tarts are small, circular tarts of flaky pastry filled with lightly sweetened egg custard.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup &#40;125 grams&#41; confectioners&#39; sugar</li>
                <li>3 cups &#40;360 grams&#41; all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup &#40;227 grams&#41; unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>1 dash vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2/3 cup &#40;134 grams&#41; white sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups &#40;1/3 liter&#41; water</li>
                <li>9 eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>1 dash vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup &#40;252 grams&#41; evaporated milk</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the confectioners&#39; sugar and flour. Mix in butter with a fork until it is in small crumbs. Stir in the egg and vanilla until the mixture forms a dough. The texture should be slightly moist. Add more butter if it is too dry, or more flour, if the dough seems greasy. Shape dough into 1 1/2 inch balls, and press the balls into tart molds so that it covers the bottom, and goes up higher than the sides. Use 2 fingers to shape the edge into an A shape.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F &#40;230 degrees C&#41;. Combine the white sugar and water in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cook until the sugar is dissolved, remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Strain the eggs through a sieve, and whisk into the sugar mixture. Stir in the evaporated milk and vanilla. Strain the filling through a sieve, and fill the tart shells.</li>
                <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown, and the filling is puffed up a little bit.</li>
            </ol>
