        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Gumbo is the official state cuisine of Louisiana, and is the product of its famous Creole-Cajun heritage. It is a heavily seasoned stew that combines several varieties of meat or seafood with a sauce or gravy, and is often eaten with white rice.</p>

                <li>roux</li>
                <li>homemade stock</li>
            </ul></p>

                <li>salt, to taste</li>
                <li>4 bay leaves</li>
                <li>Cajun seasoning blend, to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon &#40;1/2 gram&#41; dried thyme</li>
                <li>1 &#40;14.5 ounce&#41; can stewed tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 &#40;6 ounce&#41; can tomato sauce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons &#40;3 grams&#41; cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 pound &#40;450 grams&#41; lump crabmeat</li>
                <li>1 pound &#40;450 grams&#41; cooked, shredded chicken</li>
                <li>3 pounds &#40;1,350 grams&#41; uncooked shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons &#40;34 grams&#41; Worcestershire sauce</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk together flour and bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.</li>
                <li>Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped.</li>
                <li>Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in chicken and sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                <li>Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in salt, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, crushed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in corn starch at the 45-minute mark.</li>
                <li>Mix in reserved vegetables, crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes.</li>
            </ol>
